explore_multi.launch.py

WARNING: Do NOT launch this alongside frontier_coordinator — they both
publish to /<robot>/goal_pose and will fight over navigation goals.
Use ONE exploration system at a time:
  • frontier_coordinator  (custom, uses merged map, coordinates robots)
  • explore_lite           (off-the-shelf, per-robot, no cross-robot coordination)

Runs one explore_lite instance per robot (package: explore_lite, from
m-explore-ros2: https://github.com/robo-friends/m-explore-ros2), each
using that robot's OWN local_costmap/global_costmap to pick frontiers and
sending goals through that robot's OWN Nav2 stack.

This is the standard multi-robot pattern for explore_lite — it has no
built-in cross-robot coordination, so both robots occasionally head for
the same area. That's expected/normal, not a bug.

Prereq: build explore_lite into this workspace first (not an apt package
for Humble):
  cd ~/ros2_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/robo-friends/m-explore-ros2.git
  cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build --packages-select explore_lite

Run LAST, after spawn, multi_robot_slam, map_merge, and
nav2_bringup_multi are all already running:
  ros2 launch nav2_project08 explore_multi.launch.py
